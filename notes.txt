Notes:
    Finish documenting everything
    Properly import tailwind
    ADD SOMETHING TO DEAL WITH SYMBOLS if you need them

Features to list:
    All normal sections need to have at least 1 newline after them
        The section won't actually be empty unless you include an empty space
        Make sure when redirecting to add a / at the end so that it doesn't lock
    Embed text file so that SEO works (Hidden text with SEO?)
    Section dissapears if there's wrong depth
